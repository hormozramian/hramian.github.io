                Optimal Financial Regulation</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I show that when the banking sector's assets comprise large
                    excess reserves and loans, jointly determined capital regulation and interest-on-excess-reserves
                    (IOER)
                    policies provide welfare gains. In general equilibrium, falling IOER is associated with a
                    proportional fall in
                    deposit rate only when IOER is above the zero bound. This leads to a faster fall in the bank's
                    interest
                    expenses than its interest incomes. Given any lending level, lower net interest expenses enhance
                    bank
                    solvency. Nonetheless, the risk-weighted capital regulation remains unchanged and hence becomes
                    socially
                    costly. I show that jointly determined policies achieve welfare gains by loosening the capital
                    requirement and
                    lowering IOER to expand the credit flow, while bank failure likelihood remains constant. Conversely,
                    lowering
                    IOER below the zero bound is associated with a nonresponsive deposit rate that leads to growing net
                    interest
                    expenses and worsening bank solvency. In that case, I show that a stricter capital constraint
                    together with a
                    lower IOER provide social value.</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Financial Regulation and Wealth
                Distribution</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Financial regulation provides welfare gains to the society, at the expense of an exacerbated wealth
                    distribution. I
                    show that when capital markets are segmented, financial regulation leads to a transfer of wealth from depositors
                    to equity investors. An integrated monetary and financial regulatory policy achieves welfare gains due to a
                    credit flow expansion to the real sector, while default likelihood within the banking sector remains fixed.
                    Nonetheless, this constrained equilibrium allocation is associated with lower deposit rate while dividends
                    increase, leading to a wealth transfer across market segments. I provide sufficient conditions under which
                    optimal financial regulation leads to welfare gains without exacerbating wealth heterogeneity.</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Pay Banks to Lend: Targeted Long-Term
                Refinancing Operations and the Fiscal Stimulus</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The aftermath of the financial crisis inherited heightened economic uncertainty and low productivity. These
                    features prompted the banking sectors across the developed economies to rely heavily on excess reserves offered
                    by the central banks despite the negative nominal interest-on-excess-reserve (IOER) policy. Nonetheless, the
                    negative relationship between the overall interest expenses of the banking sector with the IOER around the zero
                    lower bound further exacerbates the over-reliance on excess reserves particularly when rates are negative. This
                    paper shows that the new Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) policy adopted by the central banks
                    leads to expansionary effects when the refinancing lending rates fall below the IOER. I first provide a social
                    welfare maximizing approach to determine the optimal borrowing limit. Second, I show that the policymaker's
                    decision to finance the deficit due to remunerations depends on the trade-offs between the social gains
                    associated with the expansion of lending to the real sector against the social costs of monetary tools (creating
                    money to finance the gap) the fiscal stimulus.</p>
