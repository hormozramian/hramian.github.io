      <a style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none;">Research Statement</a> <br>
      My research studies how joint macroprudential policies provide welfare gains to society. Understanding the
      interdependencies among regulatory policies remains an open area of research with welfare implications.
      Conflicting effects among policies may lead to over-regulation and disruptions in the credit flow to the real
      economy. Alternatively, policies decided in isolation may lead to under-regulation, heightened default risk with
      possibly failures with socially undesirable outcomes. My research agenda is focused on providing a framework to
      understand policy interdependencies and show how a comprehensive financial regulation collectively advances the
      efficiency of the financial system.

          Optimal Financial Regulation</a><br>
        <a style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration: none; ">Abstract: </a><a
          style="font-weight:none; text-decoration: none;">I show that when the banking sector's assets comprise large
          excess reserves and loans, jointly determined capital regulation and interest-on-excess-reserves (IOER)
          policies provide welfare gains. In general equilibrium, falling IOER is associated with a proportional fall in
          deposit rate only when IOER is above the zero bound. This leads to a faster fall in the bank's interest
          expenses than its interest incomes. Given any lending level, lower net interest expenses enhance bank
          solvency. Nonetheless, the risk-weighted capital regulation remains unchanged and hence becomes socially
          costly. I show that jointly determined policies achieve welfare gains by loosening the capital requirement and
          lowering IOER to expand the credit flow, while bank failure likelihood remains constant. Conversely, lowering
          IOER below the zero bound is associated with a nonresponsive deposit rate that leads to growing net interest
          expenses and worsening bank solvency. In that case, I show that a stricter capital constraint together with a
          lower IOER provide social value.</a><br>

          Distribution</a><br>
        <a style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration: none; ">Abstract: </a>
        Financial regulation provides welfare gains to the society, at the expense of an exacerbated wealth
        distribution. I
        show that when capital markets are segmented, financial regulation leads to a transfer of wealth from depositors
        to equity investors. An integrated monetary and financial regulatory policy achieves welfare gains due to a
        credit flow expansion to the real sector, while default likelihood within the banking sector remains fixed.
        Nonetheless, this constrained equilibrium allocation is associated with lower deposit rate while dividends
        increase, leading to a wealth transfer across market segments. I provide sufficient conditions under which
        optimal financial regulation leads to welfare gains without exacerbating wealth heterogeneity.

          Refinancing Operations and the Fiscal Stimulus</a><br>
        <a style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration: none; ">Abstract: </a>
        The aftermath of the financial crisis inherited heightened economic uncertainty and low productivity. These
        features prompted the banking sectors across the developed economies to rely heavily on excess reserves offered
        by the central banks despite the negative nominal interest-on-excess-reserve (IOER) policy. Nonetheless, the
        negative relationship between the overall interest expenses of the banking sector with the IOER around the zero
        lower bound further exacerbates the over-reliance on excess reserves particularly when rates are negative. This
        paper shows that the new Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) policy adopted by the central banks
        leads to expansionary effects when the refinancing lending rates fall below the IOER. I first provide a social
        welfare maximizing approach to determine the optimal borrowing limit. Second, I show that the policymaker’s
        decision to finances the deficit due to remunerations depends on the trade-offs between the social gains
        associated with the expansion of lending to the real sector against the social costs of monetary tools (creating
        money to finance the gap) or fiscal tools (taxation). <br>

        <a style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration: none; ">Abstract: </a>
        We use a unique firm-level dataset to examine the effect of employment tribunal legal fee of £1,200 per claimant
        in the UK on wages. Disputes presented by employees against their employers were filed costlessly until 2013
        when a sizeable legal fee to process disputes were instated. We show that the introduction of this legal fee
        disadvantaged the employees by 2.35% of their annual salaries during 2013 to 2017 when the policy was abolished.
        The cross-sectional breakdown shows that the employment tribunal fee affected employees with at managerial and
        professional occupational capacities relatively less than employees without skilled capacities by 1.88%.
        Similarly, the impact is visible across sectors with the finance sector receiving the minimal impact 1.21%
        relative to manufacturing and education with the highest disadvantage impact 3.37% of the annual salaries. <br>
