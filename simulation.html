          (Symmetrically-infromed Traders)</mark></a><br>
        This workshop is intended to familiarize students with optimal execution of bid-ask quotes. Key learning
        outcomes are:
        <ul>
          <li>Understand trade-off between posting a narrow spread against absorbing higher market demands in a
            competitive environment </li>
          <li>Understand informational give-away included in quotes posted by market participants</li>
          <li>Infer fundamental asset price to outbid the market </li>
          <li>Limit Order Book </li>

          <li>The final asset price is given by the sum of 14 numbers – each of them between $1 and $3.</li>
          $$\textrm{Asset Price}_0=\sum \textrm{Components}$$
          <li>Each group will receive one of the numbers in their packs. </li>
          <li>Group members should use this number and the known minimum and maximum boundaries ($14 and $42
            respectively,
            average $28) to form an idea about the fair value of the price. Based on these estimates, each group must
            provide executable prices to the buyside within a given time limit (fixed trade size: 10 units on each side,
            maximum bid/offer spread is $4).</li>
          <li>At the end of each round, buyside clients (facilitators) will execute the best bid and best ask quote (or
            any
            potential arbitrage opportunity) and notify the affected groups of the execution. Positions will be
            centrally
            monitored by the facilitators. After execution, all bid/ask quotes will be published anonymously and the
            game
            moves to the next round.
          <li>At the beginning of each new round, two additional numbers will be revealed, and the market making teams
            can
            adjust their bid/ask quotes – considering newly obtained price information (new numbers, bid/ask quotes of
            competitors in previous round) and positioning.</li>
          <li></li>The facilitators also provide an exit for unwanted positions. Market makers must notify facilitators
          of
          their
          desire to exit at the beginning of the round and will have to cross the bid/offer spread. Execution prices
          will
          be best uncleared bid and ask prices of the previous round (i.e. the best prices at which no trading took
          place,
          only existing positions can be traded, there are no additional size restrictions.</li>

            <li>Depending on the security, these orders may be on one exchange, or aggregated across many exchanges.</li>
