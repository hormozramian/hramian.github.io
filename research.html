      My research agenda studies intermediaries role in providing liquidity to real economy and financial regulation My
      research studies how joint macroprudential policies provide welfare gains to the society. Understanding the
      transmission channels across regulatory policies remains an open area of research with welfare implications.
      Conflicting impacts among policies may lead to over-regulation and disruptions in credit flow to the real economy.
      Alternatively, policies decided in isolation may lead to under-regulation, heightened default risk with possibly
      failures with socially undesirable outcomes.
      that
      helps to collectively advance the welfare.

          style="font-weight:none; text-decoration: none;">I show that when banking sector’s assets comprise
          large excess reserves and loans subject to non-diversifiable
          risk, a tighter risk-weighted capital regulation provides social value only when interest-on-excess-reserves
          (IOER) is positive. In general equilibrium, very low or possibly negative real IOER is associated with an
          increasingly flatter response by deposit rate that leads to, first, faster fall in bank’s interest incomes
          than
          its interest expenses, and second lower bank valuation due to higher default risk. Bank’s substitution of
          further
          loans with reserves to maintain value strains credit flow and loosens RW-capital regulation. I show that an
          optimal joint financial regulation trades off social benefits of lower costs associated with under-capitalized
          bank failure against social benefits of credit expansion to real sector.</a><br>

            <a style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration: none; ">Abstract: </a>Financial regulation provides welfare gains to the society, at the expense of exacerbated wealth distribution. I
        show that when capital markets are segmented, financial regulation leads to a transfer of wealth from depositors
        to equity investors. An integrated monetary and financial regulatory policies achieves welfare gains due to a
        credit flow expansion to the real sector, while default likelihood within the banking sector remains fixed.
        Nonetheless, this constrained equilibrium allocation is associated with lower deposit rate while dividend
        increases, leading to a wealth transfer across market segments. I provide sufficient conditions under which
        optimal financial regulation leads to welfare gains without exacerbating wealth heterogeneity.
