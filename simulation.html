            (Symmetrically-infromed Traders)</mark></a><br>
        This workshop is intended to familiarize students with the optimal execution of bid-ask quotes on a simulated
        trading platform. Key learning
        outcomes are:
        <ul>
          <li>Understand trade-off between posting a narrow spread against absorbing higher market demands in a
            competitive environment. </li>
          <li>Understand informational give-away included in quotes posted by market participants. </li>
          <li>Infer fundamental asset price to outbid the market. </li>
          <li>Understand how a 'Limit Order Book' clears the market.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <a style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none;">Instruction</a><br>
        This workshop requires each group to evaluate the fundamental asset value (average value) from the informaiton
        available (mid-range value). To post your quotes, follow the instruction in your welcome pack and submit your
        final bid/ask quotes per round:
        <ol>
          <li>The final asset price is given by the sum of 14 numbers (<a style="font-family: consolas;">components</a>)
            – each of them between $1 and $3:</li>
          $$\textrm{Asset Price}_0=\mathbb{E}_0\left[\sum_i\textrm{Component}_i\right]$$
          <li>Each group will receive one of the numbers in their packs. </li>
          <li>Group members should use this number and the known minimum and maximum boundaries ($14 and $42
            respectively,
            'mid-range' $28, but <a style="font-weight: bold;">unknown average</a>) to form an idea about the fair value
            of the price. Based on these estimates, each group must
            provide executable prices to the buyside within a given time limit (fixed trade size: 10 units on each side,
            maximum bid/offer spread is $4).</li>
          <li>At the end of each round, buyside clients (facilitators) will execute the best bid and best ask quote (or
            any
            potential arbitrage opportunity) and notify the affected groups of the execution. Positions will be
            centrally
            monitored by the facilitators. After execution, all bid/ask quotes will be published anonymously and the
            game
            moves to the next round.
          <li>At the beginning of each new round, two additional numbers will be revealed, and the market making teams
            can
            adjust their bid/ask quotes – considering newly obtained price information (new numbers, bid/ask quotes of
            competitors in previous round) and positioning.</li>
          <li>The facilitators also provide an exit for unwanted positions. Market makers must notify facilitators
            of
            their
            desire to exit at the beginning of the round and will have to cross the bid/offer spread. Execution prices
            will
            be best uncleared bid and ask prices of the previous round (i.e. the best prices at which no trading took
            place,
            only existing positions can be traded, there are no additional size restrictions.</li>
        </ol>

        <a style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none;">Optimal Execution: Trade-offs</a><br>
        A narrow spread (aggressive) implies a lower margin per transaction. However, outbiding the market participants
        enables the trader to attract a larger number of transactions (volume). If you're investing in individual
        securities, particularly less-liquid ones, it pays to be aware of bid-ask spreads when you're buying and
        selling. The bid is the price that someone is willing to pay for a security at a specific point in time, whereas
        the ask is the price at which someone is willing to sell. The difference between the two prices is called the
        bid-ask spread.
        <br><br>
        Bid-ask spreads have the characteristic of heads they win, tails you lose: If you're a seller, you receive the
        lower price (the bid), and if you're a buyer, you pay the higher price (the ask). (Note that bid-ask spreads
        aren't an issue for mutual fund buyers and sellers, at least not directly, because the fund is priced just once
        a day, and everyone pays and receives that same price.)
        <br><br>
        If you're trading highly liquid securities, the bid-ask spread will tend to be pretty inconsequential, meaning
        that buyers and sellers generally agree about what the right price for a security should be. For example, the
        bid-ask spread for the exchange-traded fund SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), which is itself dominated by heavily traded,
        household-name companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), is often just a penny or two.
        <br><br>
        But bid-ask spreads can be more onerous when you're dealing in more thinly traded securities, such as
        small-company stocks or ETFs with light trading volume. The bid-ask spread compensates the market maker in the
        security (which matches buyers with sellers) in case it can't find buyers for the shares and the price moves
        around a lot before it does. The greater the risk of that happening, the more the market maker demands in terms
        of a bid-ask spread. Think of the bid-ask spread as the markup on your purchase or sale.
        <br><br>
        So how can you reduce the drag of bid-ask spreads on your returns? At the risk of stating the obvious, reducing
        your number of transactions is a good starting point, particularly if you're dealing in any type of illiquid
        security. Another way to exert more control is to use a limit order rather than a market order. By doing so,
        you're saying that you're not going to accept any old price when buying and selling (a market order); you only
        want to transact if you can get a specific price or better.
        <br>

          <a style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none;">Limit Order Book</a><br>
          The limit order book is the list of orders (prices at which you can transact) for a given security. This
          describes an order to buy or sell a given quantity of stock at a specified limit price or better. The size is
          the number of shares to be bought or sold. An order remains in the order book until fully executed, i.e. until
          its size is zero as a result of trades. Partial executions occur as a result of trades for less than the
          entire size of the order.
          <ol>
            <li>Depending on the security, these orders may be on one exchange, or aggregated across many exchanges.
            </li>
            <li>This presentation will give a basic description of the order book, and how your transactions will be
              handled by (and how they will affect) the book.</li>
            <li>You will transact in an order book if you trade stock, futures, options, and/or other securities. </li>
          </ol>

          Consider a simple order book containing five limit orders: sell 150 shares of IBM at $11.11, sell 150 shares
          of IBM at $11.08, buy 100 shares of IBM at $11.05, buy 200 shares of IBM at $11.05, and buy 200 shares of IBM
          at $11.01. Orders on the bid (ask) side represent orders to buy (sell). The price levels are $11.11, $11.08,
          $11.05, and $11.01. The best bid at $11.05 (highest bid price) and the best ask at $11.08 (lowest ask price)
          make up the inside market . The spread ($0.03) is the difference between the best bid and best ask. The
          midpoint ($11.065) is the average of the best bid and best ask.
          <br><br>
          There are four types of messages that traders can submit to an order book: add, cancel , cancel/replace,
          and market order. A trader can add a limit order in to the order book. She can also cancel an order and
          remove it from the order book. If a trader wants to reduce the size of her order, she can issue a
          cancel/replace, which cancels the order, then immediately replaces it with another order at the same price,
          but with a lower size. Every limit order is assigned a unique ID so that cancel and cancel/replace orders can
          identify the corresponding limit order. A market order is an order to immediately buy or sell a quantity
          of stock at the best available prices. A trade occurs when a market order “hits” a limit order on the other
          side of the inside market. All orders have timestamps indicating the time at which they were accepted into the order book. The timestamp
          determines the time priority of an order. Earlier orders are executed before later orders.
