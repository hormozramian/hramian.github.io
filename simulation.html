            (Symmetrically-infromed Traders)</mark></a><br>
        This workshop is intended to familiarize students with the optimal execution of bid-ask quotes. Key learning
        outcomes are to understand the trade-off between absorbing market demand as a result of a narrow bid-ask quote
        against obtaining a lower profit margin per transaction in a competitive environment. We focus on the following
        main points:
        <ul >
          <li>Understand trade-off between posting a narrow spread against absorbing higher market demands in a
            competitive environment (<span title="closed"><a style="font-family: consolas; font-size: smaller; text-decoration: underline ; color: blue; cursor:pointer">Link to Trading Platform</a></span>)  </li>
          <li>Understand informational give-away included in quotes posted by market participants</li>
          <li>Infer fundamental asset price to outbid the market </li>
          <li>Limit Order Book </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <a style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none;">Instruction</a><br>
        This workshop requires each group to evaluate the fundamental asset value (average value) from the informaiton
        available (mid-range value). To post your quotes, follow the instruction in your welcome pack and submit your
        final bid/ask quotes per round:
        <ol>
          <li>The final asset price is given by the sum of 14 numbers (<a style="font-family: consolas;">components</a>)
            – each of them between $1 and $3:</li>
          $$\textrm{Asset Price}_0=\mathbb{E}_0\left[\sum_i\textrm{Component}_i\right]$$
          <li>Each group will receive one of the numbers in their packs. </li>
          <li>Group members should use this number and the known minimum and maximum boundaries ($14 and $42
            respectively,
            average $28) to form an idea about the fair value of the price. Based on these estimates, each group must
            provide executable prices to the buyside within a given time limit (fixed trade size: 10 units on each side,
            maximum bid/offer spread is $4).</li>
          <li>At the end of each round, buyside clients (facilitators) will execute the best bid and best ask quote (or
            any
            potential arbitrage opportunity) and notify the affected groups of the execution. Positions will be
            centrally
            monitored by the facilitators. After execution, all bid/ask quotes will be published anonymously and the
            game
            moves to the next round.
          <li>At the beginning of each new round, two additional numbers will be revealed, and the market making teams
            can
            adjust their bid/ask quotes – considering newly obtained price information (new numbers, bid/ask quotes of
            competitors in previous round) and positioning.</li>
          <li>The facilitators also provide an exit for unwanted positions. Market makers must notify facilitators
            of
            their
            desire to exit at the beginning of the round and will have to cross the bid/offer spread. Execution prices
            will
            be best uncleared bid and ask prices of the previous round (i.e. the best prices at which no trading took
            place,
            only existing positions can be traded, there are no additional size restrictions.</li>
        </ol>

        <a style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none;">Optimal Execution: Trade-offs</a><br>
        A narrow spread (aggressive) implies a lower margin per transaction. However, outbiding the market participants
        enables the trader to attract a larger number of transactions (volume). If you're investing in individual
        securities, particularly less-liquid ones, it pays to be aware of bid-ask spreads when you're buying and
        selling. The bid is the price that someone is willing to pay for a security at a specific point in time, whereas
        the ask is the price at which someone is willing to sell. The difference between the two prices is called the
        bid-ask spread.
        <br><br>
        Bid-ask spreads have the characteristic of heads they win, tails you lose: If you're a seller, you receive the
        lower price (the bid), and if you're a buyer, you pay the higher price (the ask). (Note that bid-ask spreads
        aren't an issue for mutual fund buyers and sellers, at least not directly, because the fund is priced just once
        a day, and everyone pays and receives that same price.)
        <br><br>
        If you're trading highly liquid securities, the bid-ask spread will tend to be pretty inconsequential, meaning
        that buyers and sellers generally agree about what the right price for a security should be. For example, the
        bid-ask spread for the exchange-traded fund SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), which is itself dominated by heavily traded,
        household-name companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), is often just a penny or two.
        <br><br>
        But bid-ask spreads can be more onerous when you're dealing in more thinly traded securities, such as
        small-company stocks or ETFs with light trading volume. The bid-ask spread compensates the market maker in the
        security (which matches buyers with sellers) in case it can't find buyers for the shares and the price moves
        around a lot before it does. The greater the risk of that happening, the more the market maker demands in terms
        of a bid-ask spread. Think of the bid-ask spread as the markup on your purchase or sale.
        <br><br>
        So how can you reduce the drag of bid-ask spreads on your returns? At the risk of stating the obvious, reducing
        your number of transactions is a good starting point, particularly if you're dealing in any type of illiquid
        security. Another way to exert more control is to use a limit order rather than a market order. By doing so,
        you're saying that you're not going to accept any old price when buying and selling (a market order); you only
        want to transact if you can get a specific price or better.
